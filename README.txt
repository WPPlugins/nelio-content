== Changelog ==

= 1.2.14 (June 28, 2017) =
* **Bug Fix**. Sometimes, Google Analytics view selector generated a JavaScript error and the user wasn't able to select any views. This has now been fixed.
* **Improvement**. Support for Nelio Content new plans has been added.

= 1.2.13 (May 30, 2017) =
* **Bug Fix**. Adding new social profiles refreshes the settings page properly, so that you can see the new profile instantaniously.

= 1.2.12 (May 2, 2017) =
* **Improvement**. The plugin does no longer block access to editing content when Nelio Content's API wasn't accessible.
* **Improvement**. SSL Certificate of API renewed. The temporary fix of the previous version has been reverted and the proper API URL is used.

* **Bug Fix**. SSL Certificate of API expired. This version provides a temporary fix until the SSL Certificate is renewed.

= 1.2.10 (April 19, 2017) =
* **Improvement**. Social messages of unpublished posts used to show a "fake" permalink (e.g. `https://example.com/post-name/`) in the timeline and preview sections. This has now been changed and the actual permalink of the related post is shown instead.
* **Bug Fix**. When you publish a post, the plugin sends a notification to Nelio Content's cloud so that social messages are automatically sent at the right time. If this notification failed, messages wouldn't be sent. This version detects such failure and re-synchronizes WordPress and Nelio Content to avoid this issue.

= 1.2.9 (April 6, 2017) =
* **Colors in Calendar**. Posts in the calendar now have different colors based on their status. You can disable this in _Settings_ » _Content_.
* **New Post Statuses**. We added new post statuses to improve your workflow. These statuses have their own icon and color in the calendar. You can enable them in _Settings_ » _Advanced_.
* **Improvement**. Calendar filters are now "permanent". That is, if you apply certain filters in the calendar, these filters will still be active after you reload the page.
* **Improvement**. Modified the code for extracting the author name of any given URL. The meta info extractor might still fail, but it's slightly better now.

= 1.2.8 (March 23, 2017) =

* **New Feature** (only for subscribers). Download your calendar as a CSV file.
* **Improvement**. You can now view Pages in your calendar and schedule social messages promoting them.
* **Bug Fix**. If a user can't create a post from Nelio's editorial calendar, the "Save" button label is properly updated (from, for example, "Saving" to "Save").
* **Bug Fix**. Preview card works properly when `{permalink}` set in its own line.

= 1.2.6 (March 16, 2017) =
* **Bug Fix**. Last update removed social meta box (and others) from the Edit Post screen. This has now been fixed.

* **Improvement**. Added warning message in Analytics when GA tokens expired and reauthentication is required.
* **Improvement**. Using subscription plan properly to show the right set of tools to each user.
* **Bug Fix**. Some WordPress setups modify jQuery's AJAX default headers, preventing our plugin from communicating with our cloud. We now force the appropriate headers in our own AJAX calls to solve this.

= 1.2.4 (March 14, 2017) =
* **Bug Fix**. "Too Many Requests" HTTP error doesn't block the analytics computation process.

= 1.2.3 (March 8, 2017) =

* **Improvement** (only relevant to subscribers). We added the _Share Selection_ action button in WordPress _Text_ (HTML) editor.
* **Improvement**. Added author and date filters in post analytics.
* **Bug Fix**. Task filter in calendar now shows all users in the system.
* **Bug Fix**. Removed unnecessary `error_log`s from code.

= 1.2.0 (February 1, 2017) =
* **New Feature** (only available to subscribers). Create social messages faster by selecting some text in the TinyMCE editor and clicking on the new _Share Selection_ action button.
* **New Feature**. Analytics section with information about your content's social media impact and traffic acquisition rates.
* **Improvement**. Featured images in Mega Menus (a feature from Newspaper Theme) now have the right dimensions.

* **Bug Fix**. Social messages with HTML tags in their content triggered a JavaScript error. These are now properly escaped.
* **Bug Fix**. Some plugins enqueue styles that overwrite WordPress' default rules. For instance, jQuery UI stylesheet resets the `z-index` property of jQuery dialogs, which results in those dialogs appearing below other HTML components. We tried to fix this.
* **Bug Fix**. If the user cleans the plugin, we try to clean the information in the cloud too. This failed sometimes, and resulted in the user not being able to effectively clean the plugin. This has now been fixed; if we can't access the cloud, we'll still clean the local database and let the user know something went wrong and ask them to contact us.

= 1.1.10 (December 27, 2016) =
* **Bug Fix**. Last update throwed a warning (which, in some cases, resulted in a WSOD) because the plugin tried to iterate over a non-array element returned by Nelio's settings. This has now been fixed.

= 1.1.9 (December 26, 2016) =
* **Bug Fix**. Publishing custom post types sends scheduled social messages as expected.
* **Bug Fix**. Network icons in calendar are rounded again.
* **Bug Fix**. The number of social profiles you can connect in the free version was incorrect—instead of 4, it's 6.
* **Bug Fix**. Disabled social profile networks can no longer be clicked.
* **Bug Fix**. Pinterest and Instagram require you to share an image. If you don't add one, social messages can't be saved. In the previous version, sometimes the _Save_ button remained disabled even if you added an image. This has now been fixed.

= 1.1.8 (December 19, 2016) =
* **Bug Fix**. On Chrome 55, adding images to social messages repositioned the social message dialog, making it difficult to continue to work with it. This update fixes the issue.

= 1.1.7 (December 19, 2016) =
* **Improvement**. Google Plus and Instagram support added using [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com/).
* **Improvement**. External Featured Images also work if inserted using `wp_get_attachment_image`.

* **Improvement**. Pagefrog does no longer break our plugin in custom post types.
* **Bug Fix**. JavaScript error on (some) custom post types.

= 1.1.4 (November 24, 2016) =
* **Bug Fix**. Editing a post from the _Calendar_ or using _Quick Edit_ in _All Posts_ screen removed the featured image of said post. This is now fixed.

= 1.1.3 (November 23, 2016) =
* **Bug Fix**. Pages couldn't be edited with version 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 due to an unexpected error. This has now been fixed.

= 1.1.2 (November 22, 2016) =
* **Bug Fix**. Sometimes, the post analysis reported that there was a featured image set, even if none was actually set. This has now been fixed.
* **Improvement**. Post analysis now takes into account whether the analyzed post type supports featured image and, if they're not supported, the plugin doesn't check whether the post includes one or not (it simply doesn't make sense). Similarly, tags are only checked if the analyzed post is a WordPress regular _Post_.
* **Improvement**. Tiny UI modifications in Connected Social Profiles screen.

= 1.1.1 (November 18, 2016) =
* **New Feature**. [Nelio External Featured Image](https://wordpress.org/plugins/external-featured-image/) has been re-implemented using a new engine and merged into Nelio Content. Now, you can insert Featured Images using external URLs with just a couple of clicks. It works with virtually all themes, including Newspaper, Newsmag, and Enfold, among others.
* **New Feature**. Use one of the images in the post as the featured image. This feature uses the improved external featured image engine, so that the image in the post is properly scaled and cropped when used as featured image.
* **Bug Fix**. The button for Re-Authenticating social profiles is working properly. In previous versions, the profile wasn't reauthenticated&mdash;a new profile was registered instead.
* **Bug Fix**. Social message preview for drafts now shows the post card properly in Twitter, Facebook, and so on.

= 1.1.0 (November 10, 2016) =
* **New Feature**. You can now use custom post types in the calendar! Manage your regular posts and/or custom post types from Nelio's editorial calendar and save time.
* **Improvement**. Social message preview now matches Twitter new styles (e.g. last link is hidden and only shown as a "preview card").
* **Improvement**. During installation, we now detect if the server supports SNI and, if it doesn't, we access Nelio Content's API using a secure proxy.
* **Improvement**. Select2 components are now internationalized.
* **Bug Fix**. Sometimes, Nelio's post analysis didn't analyze post length or links properly. This was supposed to be fixed in the previous version, but it wasn't. Hopefully, it is now.

= 1.0.5 (September 29, 2016) =
* **Testing Environment**. We've included a test suite in development for testing the plugin. Notice the test suite is not included in releases/tags.
* **Bug Fix**. If the post doesn't have an excerpt, the post quality analysis detects it properly and warns the user about this situation.
* **Bug Fix**. Sometimes, Nelio's post analysis didn't analyze post length or links properly. This has now been fixed.
* **Improvement**. We've extended our code base so that we can overcome some issues generated by other plugins. In this release, we added a snippet of code for [fixing these issues generated by Pagefrog](https://neliosoftware.com/blog/when-wordpress-freedom-kills-your-business/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=nc_plugin_directory&utm_medium=direct).
* **Improvement**. Previous versions of Nelio Content loaded all author users in a JavaScript object. Usually, this works perfectly fine, but on some installations with tons of "author users", page load times might be slower. We now modified this behavior so that author users are loaded "on demand", offering a more responsive UX.
* **Improvement**. Post editor dialog in calendar page has now been slightly redesigned. From now on, users can open/preview any given post from the calendar itself (there's a new action button for that).
* **Minor Improvement**. An author with the admin role now triggers a "soft warning" (orange) in the post analysis section.
* **Minor Improvement**. In a multisite installation, you can now jump to the calendar of each individual blog directly using "My Sites" in admin bar.
* **Minor Improvement**. After accepting Nelio Content's terms and conditions, new users are automatically redirected to the calendar page (instead of the account page).
* **Minor Improvement**. Refactored some portions of our code.


= 1.0.4 (September 6, 2016) =
* **Improvement**. When loading the current month in the calendar, the UI now smoothly scrolls to "today" using an animation.
* **Improvement**. First-time post analysis (right after loading the page for editing a post) is faster.
* **Improvement**. Posts without a publication date triggered a JavaScript warning. This has now been fixed and MomentJS does no longer complain.
* **Bug Fix**. Sometimes, suggested references included in a post weren't marked as such unless the user changed the post content. This has now been fixed.
* **Bug Fix**. Now, you can only add new items on future dates and today. Before the fix, you could add items on any date whose month and day was past the current date, regardless of the year (which was clearly wrong).
* **Bug Fix**. Calendar does no longer "auto-scroll" up (or down) after dragging an element around and dropping it in the top (or bottom) shadow.

= 1.0.3 (August 10, 2016) =
* **Improvement**. Shortcut to Nelio's Calendar in top admin bar, under site menu.
* **Improvement**. Social message previews highlight hashtags and mentions properly, using a library from Twitter: `twitter-text` ([see it on GitHub](https://github.com/twitter/twitter-text/)).
* **Improvement**. If your social message has multiple lines, you\'ll see them on the preview.
* **Improvement**. Default profile pictures show the first letter of the user.
* **Bug Fix**. When adding images to Twitter messages, char count didn't match Twitter's char count. As a result, some messages couldn't be shared. This has now been fixed.
* **Bug Fix**. Given a scheduled social message that's related to a published post, it can now be rescheduled in the calendar (it wasn't possible in previous versions).
* **Minor Tweaks**. A few animations and icons have been polished.

= 1.0.2 (August 2, 2016) =
* **UI Improvement**. A few dialogs are now bigger, so that internationalized titles and texts can fit in.
* **Translators & i18n**. A few more changes in our string contexts and comments, so that translators can translate the plugin easily.

= 1.0.1 (July 27, 2016) =
* **Bug Fix**. Post analysis summary and finer details now match. That is, if the post quality analysis is all green, then Nelio Content reports: _The post looks awesome!_
* **Bug Fix**. Number of words in post is properly counted when using the Text editor.
* **Bug Fix**. Internal relative links are properly managed by the post analysis. Thus, including links such as `/some-page` or `#name` work fine.
* **Translators & i18n**. Some string contexts have been changed from `user` to `text`. Hopefully, they're more consistent now.

= 1.0.0 (July 25, 2016) =
* **First Release**. This is the first release of our plugin.
